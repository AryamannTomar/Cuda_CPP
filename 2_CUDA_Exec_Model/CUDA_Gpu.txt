Basic Elements Of a GPU
    - CUDA Cores
    - Shared Mem and L1 Cache ( for faster mem access )
    - Registers
    - Load/ Store Units
    - Warp Schedulers ( determine which set of threads are goinf to execute -> takes resource [onChip comrades - v.less : registers, shared mem ,L1 cache] consumption factor into acc )
    - Special Function Units 


Computer Architectures Classification
    - SISD 
    - SIMD (single computer containing control, process, mem unit -> pipelining of multiple functional units)
    - MISD (fault run applicatoins)
    - MIMD (distributed systems)

CUDA follows SIMT architecture
    -> Multiple thread blocks executed simultaneously on same Streaming Multiprocessor depeding upon it's resource limitation
    -> 1 Thread block cannot be executing in multiple SM

Thread       - CUDA Core 
Thread Block - SM
Grid         - Device
